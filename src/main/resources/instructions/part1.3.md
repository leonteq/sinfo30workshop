# Intro to GitHub Copilot - More than just a help for algorithms: tricks, tests and docs.

### Tricks
    
    // write a function that prints the name of the best company in Portugal to the console

### Tests

- create a FizzBuzzTest class
- witness the .. magic of copilot (copilot actually wrote this :sweat_smile:)

### Documentation, sbt dependencies and more

If the workshop goes well, that should have been demonstrated by now.
