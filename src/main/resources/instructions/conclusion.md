# Conclusion

- Pros:
  - code is generated very fast, most of the time it is correct.
  - writing parts of code that you already wrote / worked with is a game changer.
  - documentation, tests can be spawned much faster.
- Cons:
  - when it's not correct, it can take a lot of time to get back on your feet.
  - if you don't exactly know what you want and how you want it, it can be hard to get the right code.
  - CoPilot is script oriented, you end up with a lot of code that is not very readable.
  - Refactoring, rearranging code is your duty.
  - Security can be a big no-no: 
    - security from your code sent to GitHub.
    - security from the code suggested by CoPilot: it can contains bugs or security issues.
- Latest news:
  - Fill-In-the-Middle incoming.
  - Java code with CoPilot: 61% of code is generated.
  - More security especially around passwords and keys.
- CoPilot, a modern washing-machine ?
